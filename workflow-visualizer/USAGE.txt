WORKFLOW VISUALIZER - Usage Guide
=================================

The Workflow Visualizer is a React application that visualizes YAML workflow files as interactive graphs using React Flow.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

1. Start the development server:
   cd workflow-visualizer
   npm run dev

2. Open your browser to: http://localhost:5173/

3. Load a workflow by:
   - Dragging and dropping a .yaml/.yml file
   - Clicking "Choose File" to browse for a file
   - Clicking "Paste YAML Text" to paste YAML content directly

WORKFLOW FILES LOCATION
-----------------------

Your workflow YAML files are located at:
  ../csv_analyzer/workflows/definitions/

Available workflows:
  - medical_insights.yaml
  - medical_early_arrival.yaml
  - salary_analysis.yaml
  - early_arrival_simple.yaml
  - medical_insights_dual_entry.yaml

FEATURES
--------

✓ Interactive graph visualization with zoom/pan
✓ Drag and drop YAML file upload
✓ Paste YAML content directly
✓ Click on nodes to see detailed information
✓ Automatic hierarchical layout based on dependencies
✓ MiniMap for navigation
✓ Workflow metadata display (name, version, description)
✓ Color-coded nodes with handler information
✓ Edge labels showing data flow

GRAPH CONTROLS
--------------

- Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out
- Click + drag: Pan the canvas
- Click node: View node details
- Click background: Deselect node
- Use controls (bottom-left) for zoom/fit/lock

NODE INFORMATION
----------------

Each node displays:
  - Block ID (label)
  - Handler function name
  - Number of inputs
  - Number of parameters

Click a node to see:
  - Full input list with sources
  - All parameters and their values
  - Data flow connections

BUILDING FOR PRODUCTION
------------------------

To build the visualizer for production:
  npm run build

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If you encounter issues:

1. Node version: Requires Node.js 18.x or 20.x
   (Vite 5.x is configured for compatibility)

2. Dependencies: Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed

3. YAML parsing errors: Ensure your YAML file follows the workflow schema:
   - Must have a 'blocks' array
   - Each block needs an 'id' and 'handler'
   - Inputs should reference other blocks via 'source'

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

Project structure:
  src/
    components/
      WorkflowLoader.jsx       - File upload and YAML input
      WorkflowVisualization.jsx - React Flow graph component
      WorkflowBlockNode.jsx    - Custom node component
    utils/
      workflowParser.js        - YAML parsing and graph generation
    App.jsx                    - Main application component

The parser automatically:
  - Extracts blocks and their dependencies
  - Calculates hierarchical positions
  - Creates nodes and edges for React Flow
  - Handles both 'name' and 'field' input formats
